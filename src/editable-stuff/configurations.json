  "aboutDescription": "A contemplative programmer and scientist. Inspired by the applications for Data Science in solving real world problems. My love of problem solving initially sent me to persue the field of Physics. While achieving my master of Physics i discovered a new love for programming, especially in the use of system modelling. This eventually led to me developing a keen interest in Data Science after graduating. Everyday I push myself to learn something new. I set out with a theory or general idea and, using the vast expanse of online knowledge, teach myself about all the tools and skills I will need to achieve the goals necessary in the project.",
